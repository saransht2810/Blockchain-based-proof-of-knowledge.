## Project Title
Blockchain-based Proof of Knowledge

## Project Description
This project aims to create a decentralized platform where users can buy, sell, and auction digital art as NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens). The platform ensures ownership verification, transparency, and security using blockchain technology.

## Project Vision
The vision of this project is to establish a trustless, immutable, and decentralized marketplace for digital artists and collectors. By leveraging blockchain, we provide a fair and secure way for artists to monetize their work and for collectors to own verifiable digital assets.

## Future Scope
- Implementation of an auction system with bid tracking.
- Integration with multiple blockchain networks for cross-chain transactions.
- Smart contract upgrades for scalability and efficiency.
- Enhanced metadata storage using IPFS or decentralized storage solutions.
- Royalty mechanisms for artists on secondary sales.
- AI-powered art authentication and fraud detection.

## Key Features
- **Minting NFTs:** Users can create and list digital art as NFTs.
- **Buying & Selling:** Secure transactions with direct ownership transfer.
- **Auction Mechanism:** Future scope includes real-time bidding for NFTs.
- **Decentralized & Transparent:** Ownership history is immutable and verifiable.
- **Secure Smart Contracts:** Ensures safe transactions without intermediaries.
